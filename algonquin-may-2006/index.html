    We went back to the park for a second weekend of brook trout fishing. See

<a href="http://jsdx.northdepot.ca/algonquin-april-2006">
last weeks trip report
</a> for our adventures bush whacking for brook trout. 
  
    Our pals from last week told us about their trip so we updated our plans. We went to
a different lake and got different weather, but lots of fun. This week was colder than 
	the week before. We had snow, sleet, 
    ice pellets, and wind on the first day before the weather changed and it warmed up
later in the afternoon. The Sunday was still cloudy but warmer so it was still comfortable.
 The first pic is the lake under a snow seige... hard to see 
    the snow but it was windy and the snow pellets stung when they hit
 your face. The gloves were a necessity.

We 
  decided to go out in the morning but canoeing in snow and wind is not much fun 
  so we took naps in the afternoon waiting for the weather to improve. It did, 
  sunny and warmer in the afternoon so out we went. We saw some brookies rising 
  and caught a couple right away. Then we went exploring. 
Here are some of the smaller brookies we caught. 
Biggest was of the weekend was around 14 but you'll need to trust the 
fishermen on that as there are no pictures of that one.</p> <br clear="all">

</a>  The bacon delivery system was improved upon. Using only tinfoil, butter and eggs,
we reproduced the Bacon and Egg English Muffin, Algonquin style. 
Our innovation was driven by remote wilderness self sufficiency and the result 
was delicious despite a lack of a huge research budget. If any large McCorporation
 wants to license our version of the
sandwich, the price would be reasonable.

<p>We also went to a second lake during the break in the weather.
Couple of hours of sun, sitting in a canoe, warm, sunny, it was beautiful...  </p>

<p>Finally, I have a message for the brookies. </p>
<img src="http://tacklebox.northdepot.ca/images/livehere.jpg" align="middle"> 
<p> <b> "You like wood, wood is good... here is some wood, you should
live here" </b>.  It would save us all sorts of time canoeing around
the lake looking for ya, if you would just stick to the wood that
would be grand!  </p>
